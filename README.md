  You're building a restaurant table reserving app that allows users to reserve tables for specified numbers of people. The app will need to show only tables that are available and the times they are available. The app will need to store reservations under a given name with a phone number and number of guests.

  Tables
    TableNum:{
      id: integer
      windows:{
        [{SpecificTime: availble/not}]
      }
    }


  Users{
    User:{
      Id: Integer
      Reservations:{
        TableNum,
        Window,
        Guests: Integer
      }
      PhoneNumber: Integer
    }
  }

  You're building a backend for a university that requires students to be able to login. Once logged in, the students can view the exam grades for their classes. They should be able to view results by semester. Each semester should only show the classes in which that student is enrolled that semester.

  Students{
    Username: String,
    Password: String,
    Semesters: {
      SemesterId: [{ClassID: Integer, ClassName: String, ClassGrade: String (char)}, ...]
    }
  }

  Semesters {
    SemesterID: Classes {
      ClassID: Integer
      ClassName: String
      }
  }

  Your eCommerce business needs to keep track of products and their prices. The products each belong to a department. The business needs to keep track of revenue as product prices change over time. The business also needs to keep track of receipts of transactions and the number of units each product has in stock.

  Products {
    Product: {
      ProductID: Integer
      ProductName: String
      ProductPrice: Number
      Units: Integer
      Department: String
    }
  }

  Receipts {
    Receipt: {
      ProductsPurchased: [{ProductID: Integer, QuantityOfProduct: Integer, UnitPrice: Number}]
      TotalPrice: Number
      TimeStamp: Date
    }
  }

  Revenue - aggregate function that sum all total prices from receipts.

  You're building an activity feed for a social media site. The feed must display a chronological list of activities for the current user's friends. These activities could potentially be any action performed on the site including uploading a photo, changing their profile, friending another user, commenting, liking etc... Further, you only want to display activities for users that the current user interacts with frequently.


  User{
    Id,
    Profile:{
      Firstname: String,
      Lastname: String,
      Bio: String,
      ProfilePic: File
    }
    Photos:[
      {
        photoId:Integer,
        image:File,
        likes:[UserIds],
        UploadedAt:Time,
        Comments: [
          {
            UserId: UserId,
            UserName: String,
            ContentL String,
            TimeStamp:time
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    Password: String,
    Email: String,
    Posts: [
      {
        Id:Integer,
        Body:String,
        Likes:[UserIds],
        TimeStamp: Time,
        Comments: [
          {
            UserId: UserId,
            UserName: String,
            ContentL String,
            TimeStamp:time
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    Activities: [
      {
        Id:Integer, Type:String, Target: {TargetId: Integer, TargetType: String},
        TargetUserID: Integer
      }
    ],
    Friends: [ids]
  }



  Aggregate Function to find active friendships:
    1st direction
      User's actions towards friends
        Spelled out in activities

    2nd direction
      Friends actions towards user
        Look in friends, get those collections of users
          Check their activities for UserId

    Return array of friends most interacted with
    Use this function on login to build news feed

  News Feed Function
    Use the return array of active friends
    Take list of activities from active friends
    Order by most recent activity
    Display activity list
